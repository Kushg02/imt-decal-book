### Example 

<div align=center>

**Prove that $11^n-6$ is divisible by 5, $$\forall \: n \in \mathbb{N}$$.**

</div>

_(A number is said to be divisible by 5 if it can be written as $5c$, for some integer $c$.)

**Base Case** <br>
$$11^1 - 6 = 5 = 5 \cdot 1$$, therefore the base case holds.

<br>

**Induction Hypothesis** <br>
Assume $$11^k - 6$$ is divisible by 5, for some arbitrary $$k$$.
