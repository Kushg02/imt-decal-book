## Division Algorithm
---

</a>

The division algorithm states that **if $$n$$ is any integer and $$d$$ is a positive integer, there exist unique integers $$q, r$$ such that**

<div align=center>

$$\boxed{n = dq + r}$$

</div>

**where $$0 \leq r < d$$**.

Here, we say that $$n$$ is the dividend, $$d$$ represents the divisor, $$q$$ represents the quotient, and $$r$$ represents the remainder.

For example, if we are considering the division of $$25$$ by $$3$$, we can say $$25 = 3 \cdot 8 + 1$$, which tells us the quotient when performing this division is $$8$$, and the remainder is $$1$$. 

As another example, we can consider the division of $$-33$$ by $$5$$: we can say $$-33 = 5 \cdot (-7) + 2$$. Notice, we still have the notion of divisors, quotients, and remainders, even when the dividend is negative. This will be especially important when we look at the following chapter.

Admittedly, the division algorithm is nothing but a fancy representation of our results from division. However, the structure that it defines will become useful to us shortly.

### Divisibility
---

</a>

In the case where $$r = 0$$ in $$n = dq + r$$, we can say that "$$d$$ **divides** $$n$$", represented visually as

<div align=center>

$$\boxed{d | n}$$

</div>

Another way of phrasing this is that $$d$$ is a **factor** of $$n$$, or $$n$$ is a **multiple** of $$d$$. 

More formally, if we have that

<div align=center>

$$\forall a \in \mathbb{N}, b \in \mathbb{Z}, a | b \implies \exists c \in \mathbb{Z}: b = ac$$

</div>

Here, we are saying that if $$a$$ divides $$b$$, then there must exist some integer $$c$$ that we can multiply by $$a$$ to get $$b$$. For example, we can say that $$8 | 24$$, since there exists some integer to multiply $$8$$ by to get $$24$$ ($$8 \cdot 3 = 24$$), but that $$\neg (5 | 24)$$, since there is no integer we can multiply $$5$$ by to get us $$24$$.

Note: Often times we will re-arrange the statement to be of the form $$n - dq = r$$ when we are concerning ourselves with the remainder. This is the same statement.

## Prime Numbers
---

</a>

We say a natural number $$p$$ is **prime** if and only if its only two divisors are $$1$$ and $$p$$ itself. If $$p$$ has factors other than $$1$$ and $$p$$, we call it **composite**. _Note: $$1$$ is neither prime nor composite._

The smallest few prime numbers are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...$$. However, it turns out that there are infinitely many primes, i.e. that there is no largest prime number. We will look at a proof of this after formalizing the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

### Finding Primes
---

</a>

Often, we like to answer the question, is $$n$$, is $$n$ prime?

One solution would be to look at all naturals between $$2$$ and $$n-1$$, inclusive, and check to see if they divide $$n$$.

```py
def is_prime(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return False
	for i in range(2, n):
		if n % i == 0:
			return False
	return True
```

However, this is significantly redundant. It turns out that we only need to check up to and including $$\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$$. This is because, if $$n$$ is not prime, then we can find $$a, b$$ such that $$n = ab$$. If we have $$a > \sqrt{n}$$ and $$b > \sqrt{n}$$, then $$ab > n$$, thus we must have at least one of $$a, b$$ being less than or equal to $$\sqrt{n}$$. If we cannot find any such factor, then $$n$$ must be prime.

An intuitive way to think about this – consider $$100 = 10^2$$. Suppose we want to find $$a, b$$ such that $$ab = 100$$. If we increase $$a$$, we must decrease $$b$$ in order for the product to remain the same. (Credits to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5811151/why-do-we-check-up-to-the-square-root-of-a-prime-number-to-determine-if-it-is-pr) for that example.)


An updated implementation of the above:

```py
def is_prime(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return False
	for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
		if n % i == 0:
			return False
	return True
```

<br>

Another question we may want to answer: given some $$n$$, how can we find all of the primes up to and including $$n$$? One way is to implement the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). We will not discuss it in depth here, but below is an interactive image showing how the algorithm works (taken from the above link).

## Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
---

</a>

The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** states that any natural number $$n > 1$$ is either a prime or can be written as a unique product of prime factors.

For example, we can say that 

<div align=center>

$$\begin{align*}2520 &= 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \\\ &=5 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \\\ &= 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \end{align*}$$

</div>

FTA states that 1) $$2520$$ can be written as a product of primes, and 2) any product of primes that equates to $$2520$$ will consist of three $$2$$s, two $$3$$s, one $$5$$, and one $$7$$.

As a result, we usually think of numbers in their **canonical representation**, that is, in the form

<div align=center>

$$\boxed{n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ... p_k^{a_k}}$$

</div>

where $$p_1, p_2, ... , p_k$$ represent the prime factors of $$n$$ and $$a_1, a_2, ... , a_k$$ represent their multiplicities ($$a_i \in \mathbb{N}_0$$). Note, we can use as many primes as we want, as we can set $$a_i = 0$$ if we are not going to use that factor. For example, we could, if we needed to, say $$75 = 2^0 3^1 5^2 7^0 11^0 ... 101^0$$.

_Note 1: The FTA is a reason why we don't consider $$1$$ to be prime. If it were prime, then we could say $$10 = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 = 1^2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 = 1^{100} \cdot 2 \cdot 5 = ...$$, which are technically all different representations, though the FTA says that there is only one unique representation of each number._

_Note 2: We restricted the exponents $$a_i$$ to be non-negative integers. However, if we allow $$a_i$$ to take on the value of negative integers as well, then this can form the basis for all rational numbers as well!_

### Proof: Infinitely Many Primes
---

</a>

Let's proceed by contradiction. Let's assume that there are only finitely many primes, say, $$p_1, p_2, p_3, ... , p_{n-1}, p_n$$. 

Now, consider $$q = p_1p_2p_3 ... p_{n - 1}p_n + 1$$. None of the primes $$p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$$ evenly divide $$q$$, as they all leave a remainder of $$1$$. Now, we have two cases:

1. $$q$$ is prime: This means we have a prime that was not in our list $$p_1, p_2, ... , p_n$$, since $$q$$ is bigger than each of these – this is a contradiction of the fact that our list contained every prime
2. $$q$$ is not prime: This means there must exist some prime $$p'$$ such that $$p' | q$$. However, $$p'$$ cannot be any one of $$p_1, p_2, ... , p_{n - 1}, p_n$$. To see this, suppose $$p' = p_i$$, where $$p_i$$ is one of the primes in the original list:

<div align=center>

$$q = p_1p_2...p_{n-1}p_n + 1$$

$$\frac{q}{p'} = \frac{p_1p_2....p_{n-1}p_n}{p'} + \frac{1}{p'}$$

$$n_2 = n_1 + \frac{1}{p'}, n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$$

</div>

If $$p'$$ was equal to one $$p_i$$, then the quotient $$\frac{p_1p_2...p_{n-1}p_n}{p'}$$ would be a natural number. However (since we're assuming $$p' | q$$) this would mean that we would need $$p' | 1$$, which is impossible, since $$p' \neq 1$$ (as $$1$$ is not prime). Therefore, $$p'$$ is a prime that was not in the original list.

All of this is to say, by contradiction, the set of all primes is not finite, and thus there are infinitely many primes, and no largest prime.

_Note: The second part of the proof isn't stating that $$q$$ must be prime. It is simply stating that our original list did not contain every single prime, and thus, there is no such list._

## Greatest Common Divisors and Lowest Common Multiples
---

</a>

We defined the canonical representation of an integer as $$n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ... p_k^{a_k}$$. We can also express standard multiplication (and division, for that matter) in terms of this new representation. 

Suppose $$n_1 = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ... p_k^{a_k}$$ and $$n_2 = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} ... p_k^{b_k}$$ (remember from above, we can set $$a_i$$ or $$b_j$$ to $$0$$ if that factor is not in use). Then, by exponent laws,

<div align=center>

$$n_1 \cdot n_2 = p_1^{a_1 + b_1} p_2^{a_2 + b_2} ... p_k^{a_k + b_k}$$

</div>

For example, suppose we have $$1200$$ and $$2520$$. 

<div align=center>

$$\begin{align*}1200 &= 2^4 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^0 \\\ 2520 &= 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \\\ \implies 1200 \cdot 2520 &= 2^7 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^3 \cdot 7^1 \end{align*}$$

</div>

<a name='gcd'>

### Greatest Common Divisor
---

</a>

Now, consider the idea of the **greatest common divisor** of two numbers $$a, b$$, denoted by $$\gcd(a, b)$$. This is, we want the largest $$d$$ such that $$(d | a) \wedge (d | b)$$. We can start by looking at the prime factorization of $$a$$ and $$b$$ – as an example, let's consider $$1200$$ and $$2520$$ from above.

We can consider each prime base separately:

- $$1200$$ has a divisor of $$2^4$$ and $$2520$$ has a divisor of $$2^3$$. The largest power of $$2$$ that is a factor of both is $$2^3$$.
- $$1200$$ has a divisor of $$3^1$$ and $$2520$$ has a divisor of $$3^2$$. The largest power of $$3$$ that is a factor of both is $$3^1$$.
- Similarly, we will choose $$5^1$$ and $$7^0$$.

Then, our greatest common divisor will be the product of each of the quantities we described above, i.e.

<div align=center>

$$\gcd(1200, 2520) = 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^0 = 120$$

</div>

We can extend this to general $$a, b$$: Suppose $$a = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ... p_k^{a_k}$$ and $$b = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} ... p_k^{b_k}$$. We can then say

<div align=center>

$$\boxed{\gcd(a, b) = p_1^{\min(a_1, b_1)} p_2^{\min(a_2, b_2)} ... p_k^{\min(a_k, b_k)}}$$

</div>

Note: Iff $$\gcd(a, b) = 1$$, we say $$a$$ and $$b$$ are **relatively prime**, or **coprime**, i.e. they share no common factors (other than $$1$$).
