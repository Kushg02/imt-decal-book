> ### Definition: **Prime, Composite** </a>
> We say an integer $$n > 1$$ is **prime** if its only factors are 1 and $$n$$. If $$n$$ has factors other than 1 and itself, then we say it is **composite**. The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.

This should be nothing new. However, what may be new is the process of checking to see if a number is prime. Of course, to see if some $$n$$ is prime, we could test to see if any of $$2, 3, ... n-2, n-1$$ divide it. However, we don't need to check any even number greater than 2, since if any other even number divides $$n$$, then so will 2. We can still throw away many potential factors, though – see if you can notice a pattern below:
