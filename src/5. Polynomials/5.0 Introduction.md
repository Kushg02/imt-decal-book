<title>5.0: Introduction â€“ Polynomials</title>

# Chapter 5: Polynomials
---

<br>

This chapter is two-fold. First, we'll continue our discussion on combinatorics by applying the ideas of counting to polynomials; specifically, we'll look at the Binomial Theorem and Vieta's Formulas. Then, we will switch gears and study the various representations of polynomials and how to convert between them (a challenging problem in its own right). We will also study the nature of polynomial factors and roots. 

There is no way that we can study all possible aspects of polynomials in just a few weeks, so we've curated a set of relevant topics. No calculus is necessary, but an understanding of basic calculus may help you understand these concepts beyond what we cover.
