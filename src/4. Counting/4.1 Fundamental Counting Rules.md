To begin, we will formalize two of the most basic rules in counting – the product rule and sum rule. We will then look at several examples that apply both of these rules.

### Example: Number of Factors 

</a>

<br>

<div align=center> <b>How many factors does $$1200$$ have?</b> </div><br>

We <i>could</i> sit down and manually enumerate through all factors of 1200, one by one - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... but that would take quite a bit of time. Instead, we will look at the prime factorization of 1200: $$1200 = 2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$$.

We know each factor of 1200 will have some number of $2$s, some number of $3$s, and some number of $5$s. There are 5 options for the number of $2$s a factor could have: 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 (meaning a factor of 1200 could either have a factor of $2^0$, or $2^1$, or $2^2$, or $2^3$, or $2^4$). Similarly, there are 2 options for the number of $3$s a factor could have (either 0 or 1) and 3 options for the number of $5$s (0, 1, or 2). 

Since we're making three successive choices, we take the product of the number of choices at each step, yielding

<div align=center> $$\text{number of factors of } 1200 = (4 + 1) (1 + 1) (2 + 1) = 30$$</div><br>

In general, if we have $$n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot ... \cdot p_k^{e_k}$$, the following holds:

<div align=center> $$\text{number of factors of } n = \prod_{i = 1}^k (e_i + 1) = (e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1) \cdot ... \cdot (e_{k - 1} + 1) \cdot (e_k + 1) $$</div><br>

### Example: Cardinality of the Power Set

</a>

The power set $$P(S)$$ of a set $$S$$ is a set of all possible subsets of $$S$$. For example, if $$S = \{1, 2, 3}$$, we have $$P(S) = \\{ \emptyset , \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\}$$.

<div align=center> <b>If $$S$$ is a set such that $$|S| = n$$, what is $$|P(S)|$$?</b> </div><br>

When creating a subset of $$S$$, for each of the $$n$$ items in $$S$$, we have two options: either we include it in the subset, or do not include it in the subset. Since we have two options for each of the $$n$$ items, the total number of ways we can create a subset of $$S$$ is $$2 \cdot 2 \cdot ... \cdot 2 = 2^n$$.
