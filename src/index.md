**This will serve as the textbook for the [UC Berkeley student-run course](http://imt-decal.org) with the same title.** It isn't meant to be a comprehensive book on any of these topics, but rather is meant to supplement the course. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions regarding any of the material in this book (whether or not you are a student at Berkeley taking this course), or want to use this book to teach your own class elsewhere, please email suraj.rampure@berkeley.edu. This is a new text, and feedback is appreciated!

From the course website:

Berkeley’s highly theoretical Computer Science curriculum demands a high level of mathematical maturity. While those with extracurricular math experience from high school are familiar with dense notation, complex mathematical objects, and proof techniques, many students find foundational courses like CS 70, CS 170, and Math 55 confusing and inaccessible.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking bridges the gap. We teach mathematical maturity. Our curriculum exposes students to familiar concepts in a more precise, generalized way. By the end of our course, students will be able to:

- comfortably read mathematical language, including notation, definitions and proofs
- concisely and clearly express their ideas differentiate between a good proof and a proof with logical gaps

As a result, this course will prepare students for higher-level mathematics courses, such as CS 70 at Berkeley. However, students can enroll in the course even if they aren’t planning on taking these courses or are not in CS/EECS; these skills and concepts are highly transferrable.

There are no prerequisites for this course. We’re working really hard to make the material accessible for all backgrounds.

Disclaimer: This course is not a prerequisite for CS 70, nor is it affiliated with the CS 70 instructors or course staff in any way. The official prerequisites for CS 70 are specified in the course description. CS 70 staff makes no guarantees regarding the material covered in this course.
