Here, we link to all of the supplementary notes written specifically for this course, organized by topic. These are meant to be supplementary to other resources – other textbooks, lectures, etc. It should also be noted that some of these notes only consist of examples or explain just one specific topic.

These notes are primarily written by Suraj Rampure, with contributions by Fahad Kamran, Hermish Mehta, Jerry Huang, and Sagnik Bhattacharya. Feel free to email `suraj.rampure@berkeley.edu` if you spot any issues with any of the notes.
