# 1.3: Sets of Numbers

We will now put together our knowledge of set theory and of functions and bijections to formally study the sets of numbers that we use everyday. 

Think about the order in which numbers are introduced to you throughout your study of mathematics:

- **Natural numbers**: We first start off by learning the counting numbers – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on
- **Whole numbers**: We then introduce the idea of the number 0
- **Integers**: The number line is then extended in the negative direction, to include negative numbers (a common way this is introduced: if you have three dollars and spend four, how many dollars do you have left?)
- **Rational numbers**: From there, we look at the idea of fractions, that is, integers divided by non-zero integers
- **Irrational numbers**: This is the first set that isn't a superset of the preceeding sets (this is an idea we will explore further in this section); irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as an integer divided by an integer, such as $$\pi$$, $$e$$ and $$\sqrt{2}$$
- **Real numbers**: The union of the rational numbers and irrational numbers
- **Complex numbers**: Complex numbers are usually introduced alongside the quadratic formula, when trying to explain the nature of complex roots; complex numbers are of the form $$a + bi$$, where $$a, b$$ are real numbers and $$i$$ is the imaginary unit defined by $$i^2 = -1$$

Recall, in the previous section, we saw that two sets have the same size when there is a bijection between the two sets. We will use this fact in determining which of the above sets have the same size, and which don't.

We first look at the
