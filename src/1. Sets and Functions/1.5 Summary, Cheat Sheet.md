| $$\\{ \\}$$ | set | used to define a set | $$S = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... \\}$$|
| $$\in$$      | in, element of | used to denote that an element is part of a set | $$1 \in {1, 2, 3}$$ |
| $$\not \in$$ | not in, not an element of | used to denote than an element is not part of a set | $$4 \not \in {1, 2, 3}$$ | 
| $$\mid S \mid$$ | cardinality | used to describe the size of a set (refers to the number of unique elements if the set is finite) | $$S = \\{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 \\}$$<br> $$\mid S \mid = 5$$ |
| $$:$$, $$\mid$$ | such that | used to denote a condition, usually in set-builder notation or in a mathematical definition | $\\{x^2 : x + 3 \text{ is prime}\\}$ | 
| $$\subseteq$$ | subset | set $$A$$ is a subset of set $$B$$ when each element in $$A$$ is also an element in $$B$$ | $$A = \\{ 1, 2 \\}$$ <br> $$B = \\{ 2, 1, 4, 3, 5 \\}$$ <br> $$A \subseteq B$$ | 
| $$\supseteq$$ | superset | set $$A$$ is a superset of set $$B$$ when $$B$$ is a subset of $$A$$ | $$A = \\{ 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 \\}$$ <br> $$B = \\{ 2, 4, 8 \\}$$ <br> $$A \supseteq B$$ |
