# The Five Proofs

We will now look at five proofs of the same result â€“ that the sum of the first  natural numbers is . It turns out that we've actually already seen many of these, but this serves as a consolidation.

## 1: Arithmetic Sum Formulation

The first proof is one we used when deriving the formula of the sum of a general arithmetic series. Once again, let  represent the value of the summation.

We can rewrite  backwards:

Notice that the first term in the top line and first term in the bottom line add to , as do the second terms, third terms, and so on and so forth.

Therefore, .

## 2: Combinatorial Proof

We'e also seen the second proof before, as an example of a combinatorial proof.
