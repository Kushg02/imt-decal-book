# Faulty Proofs

We must be careful while walking through a proof, as it is easy to fall into faulty logic. In this section, we will go through some common logical fallacies found in proofs which, upon first glance, may seem correct.

## Example: ?

**Prove that .**

Assume . Multiply both sides by 0, and we get . Therefore, .

Where was the mistake in the proof? The arithmetic was sound; both sides multiplied by 0 is, indeed, 0. No step we made was incorrect, so we have to go back to our initial assumption. **We assumed what we were trying to prove, which is a common mistake when writing proofs**. This can cause us to falsely prove a lot of false things, including that every number is equal \(by our proof above\).

Some other pieces of faulty logic found in proofs include:

* Dividing by something which could be 0
* Not switching inequalities when working with negative numbers
* Using an example as a proof for a statement which applies to multiple cases
* Introducing a variable twice with two different values

## Example: ?

**Prove that** .

Let . Then, .
