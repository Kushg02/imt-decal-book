# Properties of Polynomials

However, we will now look at these mathematical objects in a different light, and look at interesting applications, such as solutions to the above problems. There is no way that we can study all possible aspects of polynomials in just a few weeks, so we've curated a set of relevant topics. No calculus is necessary, but an understanding of basic calculus may help you understand these concepts beyond what we cover.
