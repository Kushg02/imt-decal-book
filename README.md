**This will serve as the textbook for the [UC Berkeley student-run course](http://imt-decal.org) with the same title.** It isn't meant to be a comprehensive book on any of these topics, but rather is meant to supplement the course. Feel free to reach out to the author or any contributors with questions or suggestions regarding the book.

From the course website:

Berkeley's highly theoretical Computer Science curriculum demands a high level of mathematical maturity. While those with extracurricular math experience from high school are familiar with dense notation, complex mathematical objects, and proof techniques, many students find foundational courses like CS 70, CS 170, and Math 55 confusing and inaccessible. 

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking bridges the gap. 

**We teach mathematical maturity**. Our curriculum exposes students to familiar concepts in a more precise, generalized way. By the end of our course, students will be able to:

* comfortably read mathematical language, including notation, definitions and proofs
* concisely and clearly express their ideas
* differentiate between a good proof and a proof with logical gaps

As a result, this course will prepare students for higher-level mathematics courses, such as CS 70 at Berkeley. However, students can enroll in the course even if they aren't planning on taking these courses or are not in CS/EECS; these skills and concepts are highly transferrable.
