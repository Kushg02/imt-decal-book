<p>Throughout this section, we will introduce some of the more common proof techniques that are used to verify the truth of a mathematical statement. Remember, all of these techniques assume you have some basic information present and attempt to use the information you have to arrive at the correct conclusion.</p>
<br>
<a name='direct'>
<h2>Direct Proof</h2>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
<p>The direct proof is the simplest type of proof. In a direct proof, given certain information, we determine the validity of some other information. Direct proofs are often used in mathematical formulas, where simple arithmetic manipulations of given information can get us where we need to be.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are usually given some set of facts $P$ and want to prove that some statement $S$ is true. To prove the statement $S$, we make a sequence of valid implications $P \implies S_1 \implies S_2 \implies … \implies S$, where each implication represents one step in the proof. As long as each implication we make is valid (i.e. that all of our steps are mathematically sound), we have a valid direct proof.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<div align=center>
<p><strong>Consider $x, y, z \in Z^+$. Prove that if $x | y$ and $x | z$, then $x | (y + z)$.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(The notation $a | b$ means “$a$ divides $b$”. Formally, $a | b$ means there is some integer $c$ such that $b = ac$. We will look at this further in Chapter 3. )</p>
<p>The first step in each proof is representing the information that we are allowed to assume, using precise mathematical notation. We are given that $x$ divides $y$ and that $x$ divides $z$. In mathematical notation, this means that there are integers $a_1$ and $a_2$ such that $a_1 \cdot x = y$ and $a_2 \cdot x = z$. Furthermore, since we are told $x, y$ and $z$ all belong to the set of positive integers, we know that $a_1, a_2$ must also be positive. There is not much more information we can garner from this now, so we look at what we are trying to prove.</p>
<p>By writing out equations relating $x$ and $y$ (and $x$ and $z$), we have concrete information that we can use in our proof. Then:</p>
<div align=center>
<p>$
y+z = a_1 \cdot x + a_2 \cdot x = (a_1 + a_2) \cdot x
$</p>
</div>
<p>We have shown that $y+z$ can be written as some positive integer – precisely, $a_1 + a_2$ – multiplied by $x$, hence proving $x$ divides $y+z$. This example gives us the natural flavor of direct proofs – we assume and work with the information we have, and reformulate it to match what we want to prove in some capacity.</p>
<br>
<a name='contradiction'>
<h2>Proof by Contradiction</h2>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
<p>Proof by contradiction is one of the most widely used proof techniques, and it stems from a really nice observation. The problem statement remains the same; we are trying to prove that some statement $S$ is true. We begin by assuming not $S$ – that is, that $S$ is false - and prove that there is some piece of information that is both true and false at the same time. Since this can not happen, we know that our initial assumptions must be false. Since our initial assumption was that $S$ was false, we know this cannot be the case, thus $S$ must be true, proving our statement.</p>
<p>The contradiction can come about in many ways. For example, showing two things that cannot be equal as equal – such as $0 = 2$ – or showing some given information (which was told to us to be true) is false if statement $S$ is false. Whatever the contradiction might be, this proof technique presents a relatively straightforward way to prove the validity of the statement without worrying about the specific reason why the statement it holds. In specific, proof by contradiction is powerful when trying to prove a statement which implies non-existence of some entity.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<div align=center>
<p><strong>Prove that there is no greatest even integer.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Let’s think for a second why we wouldn’t want to use direct proof in this case. To use a direct proof, we would need to somehow consider every single case and prove that it is not possible, which is virtually impossible. Instead, we go by proof of contradiction.</p>
<p>Instead, let us assume that there is a greatest even integer. Let us call this greatest even integer $m$. Define $n$ to be $m+2$. Then, $n$ is an even integer and it is strictly greater than $m$. Hence, $m$ is not the greatest even integer, which contracts our earlier assumption. This means that there is no greatest even integer.</p>
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<div align=center>
<p><strong>Prove that the negative of an irrational number is irrational.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>To prove this using a direct proof, we would need to show that there is no number for which this is not true. Instead, we go by the way of contradiction. We assume the statement is not true. The negation of this sentence states that there is <em>some</em> irrational number for which its negation is actually rational. Call this number $x$. So, $-x = \frac{a}{b}$, for $a, b \in Z$. We can multiply each side by $-1$ and obtain that $x = -\frac{a}{b} = \frac{-a}{b}$. It is important to note that $-a$ is still an integer, as is $b$. So, $x$ is actually equal to the division of two integers, which proves it to be rational. But, we assumed $x$ to be irrational to begin with. A number can not be rational and irrational at the same time, so we have arrived at a contradiction. Hence, our initial assumption must have been incorrect, and there does not exist any irrational number for which its negation is rational.</p>
<p>Getting a handle on this proof technique is tricky, and only practice can really solidify a true understanding of it.</p>
<br>
<a name='contraposition'>
<h2>Proof by Contraposition</h2>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
<p>Recall from Chapter 1.5, the contrapositive of an implication $P \implies Q$ is $\neg Q \implies \neg P$. Implications and their contrapositives are logically equivalent statements. Contrapositives are useful in cases where we are asked to prove some statement $Q$ from some set of information $P$: instead of proceeding with a direct proof, we can instead assume that $Q$ is false and make a series of logical deductions that imply that $P$. In many cases, this is easier to do than proving that $P$ implies $Q$ directly.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<div align=center>
<p><strong>Prove that if $x^2$ is even, then $x$ is even.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>We can easily use a direct proof for this problem, though we will use contrapositive to introduce the general problem solving technique.</p>
<p>Remember, the contrapositive is of the form not $Q$ implies not $P$ (if our original problem statement reads $P$ implies $Q$). Here, $P$ is the statement “$x^2$ is even”, while $Q$ is “$x$ is even.” Thus, the contrapositive states that if $x$ is not even, then $x^2$ is not even either. Proving this will prove our original statement.</p>
<p>So we begin. If $x$ is not even, then $x$ is odd. Hence, $x^2$ is the product of two odd numbers, which in itself is odd. So, $x^2$ is not even, and we have proven the contrapositive. The validity of our original statement is then asserted.</p>
<br>
<a name='cases'>
<h2>Proof by Cases</h2>
<hr>
</a>
<p>The last proof technique we will discuss in the section is proof by cases. In many instances, we may find it easier to view a statement as the combination of many sub-cases. By proving each possible sub-case, we can prove the validity of the full statement. The technique we use for each sub-case can be any one of the above.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<div align=center>
<p><strong>Prove that the cube of any integer is either a multiple of 9, 1 more than a multiple of 9, or one less than a multiple of 9.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The cases we break this proof into may seem rather arbitrary, but the more we practice this sort of proof, the more natural it will seem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Case 1</em>: $n = 3k$ <br>
First, we look at numbers that are divisible by 3, which we can represent as $3k$ for some positive integer $k$. Cubing $n$, we get $n^3 = (3k)^3 = 27k^3 = 9(3k^3)$. Clearly, for all $k$, this is a multiple of $9$, therefore we’ve proved the statement for all integers that are multiples of 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Case 2</em>: $n = 3k + 1$ <br>
Next, we explore the case where there is a remainder of 1 after dividing by 3, so the number is $3k + 1$ for some $k$. Cubing $n$ yields $n^3 = (3k+1)^3 = 27k^3 + 27k^2 + 9k + 1 = 9(3k^3 + 3k^2 + k) + 1$, which shows that in this case $n^3$ is 1 greater than a multiple of 9. Thus, we’ve proved the statement for all integers that have remainder 1 when divided by 3.</p>

<li>
<p><em>Case 3</em>: $n = 3k + 2$ <br>
The last case is when a number has a remainder of 2 when being divided by 3. This means we can write $n$ as $3k+2$; equivalently, we can write $n$ as being 1 less than a multiple of 3, i.e. $n = 3k - 1$ (think about why this is true). Then, $n^3 = (3k-1)^3 = 27k^3 - 27k^2 + 9k - 1 = 9(3k^3 - 3k^2 + k) - 1$, which shows in this case that $n^3$ is 1 less than a multiple of 9. Now, we’ve proved the statement for all integers that have remainder 2 when divided by 3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have considered three cases, and these three cases make up the whole universe of integers. Either an integer is divisible by 3, one more than a multiple of 3, or 2 more than a multiple of 3 (and consequently, 1 less than some other multiple of 3). The statement holds for these three cases, so it holds for every integer. It may not be immediately evident why splitting this problem into cases is the best way to proceed, but that is what practice is for.</p>
<br>
<p>One thing to note – there are multiple ways to prove any one statement. They may all use the same proof technique, but use the given information differently.</p>
<p>In the next article, we will round out our proof toolbox with a more complicated proof technique – mathematical induction.</p>
